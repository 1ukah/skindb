# skindb (WIP)
bare bones bot made for archiving counter-strike: global offensive skins. 
reading data from discord chat using discordjs and writing them into a json file using lowdb.

# dependencies
- discordjs [14.7.1]
- @discordjs/rest [1.4.0]
- dotenv [16.0.3]
- lowdb [1.0.0]

improving my javascript knowledge and learning how to use discordjs v14 properly(not really)!
